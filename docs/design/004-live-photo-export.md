# Portable Live Photo export

Status: implementation in progress; Photos-library import acceptance is pending.

A Live Photo is a still image plus a paired movie. Neither an ordinary JPEG nor
an ordinary MOV alone is advertised as a Live Photo. Lytronaut packages the complete
`focus.JPG`, `focus.MOV`, and `provenance.json` in one ZIP download. Extract all
three files; import the JPEG and MOV together into Photos. Import behavior is a
platform compatibility gate; a ZIP itself is not a Photos-native photo asset.

Motion is a generated focus animation from verified stored planes. It is not a
camera-recorded temporal movie, a calibrated reconstruction, or a replay of
imported aperture, perspective, tone, denoise, or animation settings. Originals
and imported recipes are never changed.

The portable native/Rust-WASM core independently writes H.264 Baseline Level 5
I_PCM pictures and QuickTime sample tables. Every picture is an independent IDR;
there is no temporal prediction or external multimedia executable. The larger
uncompressed movie is intentionally bounded rather than silently installing a
C++/FFmpeg/GPL dependency or requiring an Apple production server. Native exports
decode verified stored JPEG planes. Browser exports use actual WebCodecs
configure/decode/flush results for archived AVC, then pass verified decoded RGB
into the same Rust encoder. No browser `isConfigSupported` result alone establishes
availability.

The source stack has 2–64 finite unique lambdas. The deterministic ascending-lambda
sweep preserves the selected key and both endpoints, subsampling intermediate
planes when the worst-case encoded size would exceed the movie budget. Duration
is exactly three seconds, with uniform sample durations and no audio track.
The cap is 16 MiB MOV and 18 MiB complete ZIP. Geometry is preserved, with even
width/height at most 2048 and at most two million visible pixels; unsupported
geometry receives an actionable still-export fallback. Existing JPEG stacks
retain their stricter 512-pixel limit. Explicit EXIF orientation is baked into
both resources; the new JPEG declares orientation 1. Archived AVC initially uses
identity orientation, matching its existing verified viewer capability.

Source color profiles remain unknown. Numeric decoded RGB is encoded with sRGB
transfer, BT.709 primaries, BT.601 limited-range YCbCr and 4:2:0 chroma averaging.
This documents an export interpretation, not recovered camera calibration.
The key JPEG adds compression loss; movie chroma averaging and quantization also
add loss. Provenance carries these facts separately. Neither resource copies
serial numbers, source paths, source UUIDs, legacy metadata, or private hashes.
A fresh export-only UUID pairs the JPEG Apple MakerNote key 17 and MOV content
identifier. The `mebx` timed metadata track uses `still-image-time` SInt8 -1 at
the selected image's actual presentation time.

Native exports reuse durable job admission, cancellation, cleanup, download
streaming, and completion publication. A failed, cancelled, or interrupted job
cannot offer a half-pair. Deployment-level exact Host/Origin and mutation intent
protection applies; this feature introduces no accounts or login setup.

Archived AVC export runs locally in the browser, with cancellation on navigation
or unmount, bounded progress, two queued decoder chunks and one decoded plane at
a time. It offers only the complete ZIP and revokes its temporary download URL.
It does not claim a durable server job or resume after the tab closes.

The independently authored synthetic native example is
`cargo run -p lytronaut-format --example live_photo -- /tmp/task-specific-output`.
The macOS test-only `scripts/verify-live-photo.swift` checks decoded frame colors,
selected still, duration, geometry, no audio, pairing and timed metadata, plus
rejection of an intentionally mismatched pairing identifier. It uses resource
loaders without opening a Photos library. `scripts/live-photo-test.cjs` exercises
the actual Rust-WASM path with the existing public synthetic AVC fixture,
including cancellation, unsupported codecs, actual software retry and complete
pair download. These programs still require execution against the final build;
their presence alone is not compatibility evidence.

The independent format spike used invented solid red/green/blue pixels. Chrome
154 software-preference decoding and Apple's AVAssetReader decoded all three
Rust I_PCM frames with matching color (within one byte of rounding). Apple's
metadata reader found one content identifier, one timed metadata track, and the
selected key time. `PHLivePhoto.request` recognized the fully Rust-metadata pair
without a library import or any owner Photos/default-state change. The actual
production mux/encoder core was separately exercised with a test-only synthetic
JPEG provider: ascending reordered blue/red/green playback and key time 1.0 s
were read correctly; the ZIP passed an independent `unzip -t` check. These are
format-spike results, not a substitute for final native/WASM/API/UI validation or
an isolated Photos-library import with visible working motion. No iOS device
verification is claimed.
